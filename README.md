rails-tutorials
===============

This repository will contain code from the official rails turtorials.

I have been using rails in the past, I did read the book [Agile Web Development with Rails](http://pragprog.com/book/rails2/agile-web-development-with-rails), coding along all the way to the last chapter.

Now I want to refresh and update those learned lessons, and store the resulting code here in my GitHub account as I go.
